## Description

A tool to dynamically generate and split resmoke tests for the 10gen/mongo project into sub-tasks
that can be run in parallel. For example, a task that runs in 2 hours could be split into 4 sub-tasks
that can be run in parallel to reduce the wall-clock time of to closer to 30 minutes.

The tool will use [Evergreen Test Stats](https://docs.devprod.prod.corp.mongodb.com/evergreen/Project-Configuration/Evergreen-Data-for-Analytics#evergreen-test-statistics)
to determine how to divide the tests between sub-tasks. If test stats are not available for any
reason, it will fallback to splitting tests so that each sub-tasks contains an equal number of tests.

The tool will generate fuzzer tasks as well. In the case of fuzzer tasks, the generation
determines the amount of fuzzer tests to generate. There are two controls for how many fuzzer tests
to generate, `n_files` and `n_tasks`. They should be specified in the task definition in the evergreen
config file. `n_files` controls how many fuzzer files will be generated in each sub-task, effectively
controlling the runtime of each subtask. `n_tasks` controls how many sub-tasks will be generated.
For example, if `n_files=3` and `n_tasks=5`, a total of 15 files will be run in 5 sub-tasks.

## Getting Help

channel, or email us at devprod-correctness-team@mongodb.com.

### How can I request a change/report a bug in _Mongo Task Generator_?

Create a [DEVPROD ticket](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/DEVPROD) in Jira.

### What should I include in my ticket or question?

Please include as much information as possible. This can help avoid long information-gathering threads.

Please include the following:

## Dependencies

This project is built to run on linux. It is tested on Ubuntu 24.04 x86.

The [evergreen CLI](https://docs.devprod.prod.corp.mongodb.com/evergreen/CLI) is
required.

## Installation

The tool can be downloaded from the [github releases](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-task-generator/releases)
page. It is currently built on Ubuntu 24.04 x86.

The install can be automated using a tool like `wget` or `curl`:

```bash
wget https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-task-generator/releases/latest/download/mongo-task-generator
```

## Building from source
If you aren't on a system the Ubuntu 24.04 x86 release is compatible with, you can build from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-task-generator.git
cd mongo-task-generator
rustup run 1.81 cargo build --release

./target/release/mongo-task-generator --help
```

## Usage

To generate the task information, run the `mongo-task-generator` command at the root of the
mongodb repository. The generated configuration will be created in the `generated_resmoke_config`
directory. The `evergreen_config.json` file in that directory should be passed to evergreen as
part of a [`generate.tasks`](https://docs.devprod.prod.corp.mongodb.com/evergreen/Project-Configuration/Project-Commands#generatetasks)
command call.

```bash
mongo-task-generator --help
Usage: mongo-task-generator [OPTIONS] --expansion-file <EXPANSION_FILE>

Options:
      --evg-project-file <EVG_PROJECT_FILE>
          File containing evergreen project configuration [default: etc/evergreen.yml]
      --expansion-file <EXPANSION_FILE>
          File containing expansions that impact task generation
      --evg-auth-file <EVG_AUTH_FILE>
          File with information on how to authenticate against the evergreen API [default: ~/.evergreen.yml]
      --target-directory <TARGET_DIRECTORY>
          Directory to write generated configuration files [default: generated_resmoke_config]
      --use-task-split-fallback
          Disable evergreen task-history queries and use task splitting fallback
      --resmoke-command <RESMOKE_COMMAND>
          Command to invoke resmoke [default: "python buildscripts/resmoke.py"]
      --generate-sub-tasks-config <GENERATE_SUB_TASKS_CONFIG>
          File containing configuration for generating sub-tasks
      --burn-in
          Generate burn_in related tasks
      --burn-in-tests-command <BURN_IN_TESTS_COMMAND>
          Command to invoke burn_in_tests [default: "python buildscripts/burn_in_tests.py run"]
      --s3-test-stats-bucket <S3_TEST_STATS_BUCKETT>
          S3 bucket to get test stats from [default: mongo-test-stats]
  -h, --help
          Print help
```

### High Level Architecture

Flow chart of generating tasks:

    A[Read Evergreen Project Config] -->B(For each task in each build variant)
    B --> C{task is generated?}
    C --> |No| B
    C -->|Yes| D{task is fuzzer?}
    D -->|Yes| E[Generate Fuzzer based on task definition]
    E --> B
    D -->|No| F[Lookup task runtime history from Evergreen]
    F --> G{valid history obtained?}
    G --> |Yes| H[Split task by test runtimes]

    H --> J[Generate resmoke suite config]
    I --> J
    J --> |generated task definitions|B

    K --> L[Create task specs and display tasks in Build Variant]
    L --> M[Create shrub config]
    M --> N[Write shrub config to disk]
    N --> O([End])
```

### Setting up a local development environment

Make sure you have a rust development environment installed. See instructions [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started).

From the root of the repository, run `cargo build` to build the project.

You may want to pin the rust toolchain to the same one we use to test/release: `rustup default 1.81`

### linting/formatting

```bash
cargo fmt
cargo clippy
```

### Running tests

```bash
cargo test
```

### Versioning

This project uses [semver](https://semver.org/) for versioning.

Please include a description what is added for each new version in `CHANGELOG.md`.

### Code Review

This project uses the [Evergreen Commit Queue](https://github.com/evergreen-ci/evergreen/wiki/Commit-Queue#pr).
Add a PR comment with `evergreen merge` to trigger a merge.

### Deployment

Deployment is done via github actions. Deployment can be triggered via a git tag. To create a
deployment, tag the commit you wish to deploy with a git tag and push the tag to the remote
repository.

The git tags should be formatted as follows: "v" followed by the 3 number version being deployed.
For example, "v0.1.0".

```bash
git tag v0.1.0
git push origin --tags
```

The tagged version will be deployed to the [github release](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-task-generator/releases)
for the project.
